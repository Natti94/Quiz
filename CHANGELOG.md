# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository will be documented in this file. The changelog is generated automatically by semantic-release when the `main` branch receives new commits that trigger releases.

- Initial monorepo changelog (migrated from per-package changelogs).

## Migrated history

This repository previously generated per-package changelogs (for example `quiz-frontend/CHANGELOG.md`). Those entries have been retained in Git history but a single root `CHANGELOG.md` will be generated from now on.

If you need to see a package-level history, use `git log --quiz-frontend` or check the removed `quiz-frontend/CHANGELOG.md` entry in the repo history.
